^{Ami\z}Lately, I've been, ^{C\z}I've been losing sleep

^{G\z}Dreaming about the things that ^{F}we could be.

But ^{Ami\z}baby, I've been, ^{C\z}I've been praying hard,

^{G\z}Said, no more counting dollars

^{F\z}We'll be counting stars, yeah ^*{\z F}we 'll be counting stars.

\sloka
I see this ^{Ami\z}life like a swinging vine,

^{C\z}Swing my heart across the line.

^{G}In my face is flashing signs

^{F}Seek it out and ye shall find.

Oh,~but I'm not that old

Young, but I'm not that bold

I~don't think the world is sold

I'm just doing what we're told.


\refren[1]
^{Ami C \z}I~feel~something so ^{G\z}right

Doing the ^{F\z}wrong thing.

I~feel~something so wrong

Doing the right thing.

^{F\z}I~could lie, could lie, could lie

Everything that kills me makes me feel alive.

I feel the love and I feel it burn

Down this river, every turn

Hope is a four-letter word

Make that money, watch it burn

Oh, but I'm not that old

Young, but I'm not that bold

I don't think the world is sold

I'm just doing what we're told

I could ^{F\z}lie, could lie, could lie.

^{F}Everything that downs me makes me wanna fly.

Sink in the river,
