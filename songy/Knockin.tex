	^{G}Mama, ^{D}take this badge off of me ^{Ami} 
 
	^{G\z}I~can't ^{D}use it ^{C}anymore. 
 
	It's gettin' dark, too dark for me to see.

	I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

\refren
	^{G}Knock, knock, ^{D}knockin' on heaven's  ^{Ami}door.

	^{G}Knock, knock, ^{D}knockin' on heaven's  ^{C}door. 
 
	Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door.

	Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door.

\sloka
	Mama, put my guns in the ground 

	I can't shoot them anymore. 

	That long black cloud is comin' down. 

	I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.
