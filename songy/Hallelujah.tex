	I ^{C \z}heard there was a ^{Ami}secret chord

	That ^{C \z}David played and it ^{Ami}pleased the lord

	But ^{F}you don't really ^{G}care for music, ^{C}do you?^{G}

	Well ^{C}it goes like this: the ^{F \z}fourth, the ^{G \z}fifth,

	The ^{Ami}minor fall and the ^{F \z}major lift,

	The ^{G \z}baffled king ^{E7}composing Halle^{Ami}lujah!

	^{F}Hallelujah, ^{Ami}hallelujah, ^{F}hallelujah,

\sloka
	Your faith was strong, but you needed proof,

	you saw her bathing on the roof,

	her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you.

	She tied you to a kitchen chair,

	she broke your throne, and she cut your hair,

	and from your lips she drew the Hallelujah!


\refren


\sloka
	You say I took the name in vain,

	I do not even know the name,

	but if I did, well really, what's it to you?

	There's a blaze of light in every word,

	it doesn't matter which you heard,

	the holy or the broken Hallelujah!


\refren

	Baby, I have been here before,

	I know this room, I've walked this floor,

	I used to live alone before I knew you.

	I've seen your flag on the marble arch,

	but love is not a victory march,

	it's cold and it's a broken Hallelujah!

\refren

\sloka
	There was a time you let me know,

	what's really going on below,

	but now you never show it to me, do you?

	But I remember, when I moved in you,

	and the holy dove was moving too,

	and every breath we drew was Hallelujah!

\refren

\sloka
	Maybe there's a God above,
	
	but all I've ever learned from love
	
	was how to shoot at someone who

	outdrew you.

	But it's not a cry that you hear at night,

	it's not somebody who's seen the light,

	it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah!

\sloka
	I did my best, it wasn't much,

	I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch,

	I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool

	you.

	And even though it all went wrong,

	I'll stand before the Lord of Song

	with nothing on my tongue but

	Hallelujah!
