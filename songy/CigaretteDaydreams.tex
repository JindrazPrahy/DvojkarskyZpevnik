^{D}Did you stand there all ^{Dmaj7}alone?

Oh ^{Emi\z}I~cannot ^{G}explain what's ^{A \z}going down.

I can see you standing next to me

In and out somewhere else right now.

^{D}You sigh, ^{Dmaj7 \z}look away ^{Hmi}

^{G}I can see it ^{A \z}clear as ^{\z D}day.

Close your eyes, ^{Dmaj7\z}so~afraid ^{Hmi}

^{G}Hide behind that ^{A \z}baby ^{D \z}face.

Do do do ^{Dmaj7\z}~do do do ^{Hmi Emi}

Looking for the ^{F^{\#}mi \z}answers in the pouring ^{\z Hmi}rain.

You wanna ^{\z D}find peace of ^{\z G}mind

Funny how it seems like yesterday

As I recall you were looking out of place.

Gathered up your things and slipped away

No time at all I followed you into the hall.

Cigarette daydream

You were only seventeen

So sweet with a mean streak

Nearly brought me to my knees.

Do do do do do do

\refren[1]
You can drive all night

Looking for the answers in the pouring rain.

You wanna find peace of mind

Looking for the answer.
