^{F\z}Spooky, ^{E}scary ^{Am C\z}skeletons send ^{F\z}shivers ^{Am}down your ^{E}spine

^{F\z}Shrieking ^{E}skulls will ^{Am}shock ^{C}your soul, ^{F}seal your ^{Am}doom ^{E}tonight

Spooky, scary skeletons speak with such a screech

You'll shake and shudder in surprise when you hear these zombies shriek


\refren
We're so sorry skeletons, you're so misunderstood

You only want to socialize (But I don't think we should)

\sloka
'Cause spooky, scary skeletons shout startling, shrilly screams

They'll sneak from their sarcophagus and just won't leave you be

\refren
Spirits, supernatural are shy, what's all the fuss?

But bags of bones seem so unsafe, it's semi-serious!


\sloka
Spooky, scary skeletons are silly all the same

They'll smile and scrabble slowly by and drive you so insane!

Sticks and stones will break your bones, they seldom let you snooze

Spooky, scary skeletons will wake you with a boo!
