	I ^{C \z}hurt ^*{\z D}myse lf ^{\z Ami}today~~~ to ^{C}see if ^{D}I still ^{Ami}feel,

	^{\phantom{.}}I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real.

	^{\phantom{.}}The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting,

	Try to ^{C \z}kill it ^{D} all ^{\z Ami}away, but ^{C}I ^*{\z D}reme mber ^*{\z G}everyth ing.

	^{Ami}What have I ^*{\z F}beco me, ^{C} my sweetest ^{G \z}friend?

	^{\phantom{.}}Everyone I know goes away in the end.

	And ^{Ami \z}you~could have it ^{F}all, ^{G}my empire of dirt,

	^{\phantom{.}}I will let you down, I will make you hurt.

\sloka
	I wear this crown of thorns upon my liar's chair,

	Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair.

	Beneath the stains of time the feeling disappears,

	You are someone else, I am still right here.


\refren\\\\

	^{Ami\z}If~I~could start ^*{\z F}aga in, a ^{G \z}million miles away,

	^{Ami\z}I~would keep ^*{\z F}myse lf, ^{G}I would find a ^{(Ami)}way.
