\sloka
^{C}All my bags are packed I'm ^{F \z}ready to go.

I'm ^{C \z}standing here ^*{\z F}outsi de your door.

I ^{C}hate to wake you up to ^{F}say ^*{\z G7}goodby e,

^{\phantom{.}}But the dawn is breaking it's early morn.

^{\phantom{.}}The taxi's waitin' he's blownin' his horn.

^{\phantom{.}}Already I'm so lonesome I could die.

\refren
So ^{C}kiss me and ^{F \z}smile for me,

^{C \z}Tell me that you'll ^{F}wait for me,

^{C \z}Hold me like you'll ^{F \z}never let me ^{G7}go.

Cause ^{C}I'm leavin' ^{F}on a jet plane,

^{C \z}Don't know when ^{F}I'll be back again.

^{C \z}Oh, ^{F \z}babe I hate to ^{G7}go.

\sloka
There's so many times I've let you down,

So many time I've played around.

I tell you now they don't mean a thing.

Every place I go I'll think of you,

Every song I sing I'll sing for you. 

When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring.

\refren

\sloka
Now the time's come to leave you.

One more time let me kiss you. 

Close your eyes I'll be on my way. 

Dream about the days to come

When I won't have to leave alone.

About the times I won't have to say:
