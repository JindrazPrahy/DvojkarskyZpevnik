\sloka
   ^{Ami\,}Hello darkness my old ^{G\z}friend

   I\ap ve come to talk with you ^{Ami\,}again

   Because a vision softly ^{F{\:\:}\:\:C{\z}}creeping

   Left its seeds while I was ^{F{\:\:\:\:}C{\z}}sleeping.

   And the ^{F\z}vision that was planted in my ^{C\z}brain

   Still ^{Ami}remains within the ^{G\z}sound of ^{Ami\z}silence.

\sloka
   In restless dreams I walked alone,

   Narrow streets of cobble-stone,

   \ap neath the halo of a street lamp

   I turned my collar to the cold and damp.

   When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light

   That spilt the night and touched the sound of silence.

\sloka
   And in the naked light I saw

   Ten thousand people maybe more.

   People talking without speaking,

   People hearing without listening,

   People writing songs that voices never share,

   And no one dare disturb the sound of silence.

\sloka
   ``Fools!'' said I ``You do not know

   Silence like a cancer grows

   Hear my words that I might teach you

   Take my arms that I might reach you.''

   But my words like silent raindrops fell

   And echoed in the wells of silence.

\sloka
   And the people bowed and prayed

   To the neon god they made

   And the sign flashed out its warning

   In the words that it was forming and the sign said:

   ``The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls

    And tenement halls.'' and whisper\ap d in the sound of silence.
