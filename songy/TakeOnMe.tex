Take me on (Take on me)

So needless to say

I'm odds and ends

Slowly learning that life is okay

Say after me

It's no better to be safe than sorry.

All things that you say, yeah

Is it life or just to play my worries away?

You're all the things I've got to remember

You're shying away

I'll be coming for you anyway.
