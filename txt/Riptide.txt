                          Riptide
                           Vance Joy


    Ami             G                 C
 1. I was scared of dentists and the dark
    I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
    Oh, all my friends are turning green
    You’re the magician’s assistant in their dream.

R1 : Ooh, ooh, ooh
     Oh, and they come unstuck.

R2 : Lady, running down to the riptide
     Taken away to the dark side
     I wanna be your left hand man.
     I love you when you’re singing that song
     And I got a lump in my throat
     ’Cause you’re gonna sing the words wrong.

 2. There’s this movie that I think you’ll like,
    This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City,
    This cowboy’s running from himself,
    And she’s been living on the highest shelf.

R2 :

 3. I just wanna, I just wanna know
    If you’re gonna, if you’re gonna stay.
    I just gotta, I just gotta know
    I can’t have it, I can’t have it any other way.
    I swear she’s destined for the screen
    Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you’ve ever seen, oh.

R2 : 3×
