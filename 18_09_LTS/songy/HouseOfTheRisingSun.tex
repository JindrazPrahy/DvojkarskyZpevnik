\sloka 
	^{Ami\,}There is a ^{C{\color{white}\_\_}}house in ^{D{\color{white}\_}}New ^{F}Orleans

	They ^{Ami}call the ^{C{\color{white}\_\_}}Rising ^{E}Sun

	And it's ^{Ami}been a ^{C}ruin of ^{D}many a poor ^{F}boy

	And ^{Ami}God I ^{E}know I'm ^{Ami}one. ^{C\,D\,F\,Ami\,E\,Ami\,E}

\sloka
	My mother was a tailor
	
	Sewed my new blue jeans,
	
	My father was a gamblin' man
   	
   	Down in New Orleans.

\sloka
	Now the only thing a gambler needs

	Is suitcase and trunk

	And the only time he's satisfied

	Is when he's on, a drunk.

\sloka
	Oh mother tell your children

	Not to do what I have done

	Spend your lives in sin and misery

	In the House of the Rising Sun.

\sloka
	Well, I've got one foot on the platform

	The other foot on the train

	I'm going back to New Orleans

	To wear that ball and chain.

\sloka = 1.
